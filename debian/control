Description: Python wrapper for GnuPG
 A Python interface for handling interactions with GnuPG, including keyfile
 generation, keyring maintenance, import and export, encryption and decryption,
 sending to and recieving from keyservers, and signing and verification.
 .
 This is a fork of python-gnupg (from version 0.3.2), patched to sanitize
 untrusted inputs, due to the necessity of executing subprocess.Popen([...],
 shell=True) in order to communicate with GnuPG. Several speed improvements were
 also made based on code profiling, and the API has been cleaned up to support
 an easier, more Pythonic, interaction.
