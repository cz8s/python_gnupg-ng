Description: Python wrapper for GnuPG
 Python module providing easy access to GnuPG's key management, 
 encryption and signature functionality from Python programs, by 
 interacting with GnuPG through file descriptors. Input arguments are
 are strictly checked and sanitised, and therefore this module should be
 safe to use in networked applications requiring direct user input. It
 is intended for use with Python 2.6 or greater.

 python-gnupg-ng is a temporary "fork" of python-gnupg used, among others, by the LEAP project.
